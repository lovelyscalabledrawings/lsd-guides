  ## HTML: Add things that filter data
  
  So once again, a grid is actually a form. Its **action** is where
  it sends requests to get filtered list items set. Filter conditions
  are specified through field values and their names. 
  
  Form makes use of two custom attributes:
  
  * **transport=xhr** turns the form into an ajaxy mode where it sends
    its contents asynchronously and waits for response. The page does not change. 
  * **target** specifies the target for interactions. Any widget that does requests
    first *submits* itself and then *updates* the target. So if the target is set,
    it will be updated with the contents returned from form's requests.
    
    Target attribute accepts any selector. It does its searches in a widget
    tree by default, so "grid list" selector finds the widget that is initialized
    on "ul" element. That relation was set on the first step.
-->
<form action='/people' class='grid' target='grid list' transport='xhr'>
  <!--
    If we need to filter the grid by some query string, it's easy. Search field
    here submits the whole form
    
    ## Custom widgets
    
    Here we create our first custom widget - selectlist. When it comes to selecting
    an item from a list, it always comes down to these two cases (as in ([HTML5 command types](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/commands.html#command-facet-type) spec):
  -->
  <nav>
    <input name='q' type='search' />
    <button type='submit'>Send</button>
    <!--
      ## Radiogroup (&lt;select&gt;)
      
      A group of items where only one item can be selected at once is called a radiogroup.
      Only the selected element sends its value with form, so query string is simply `?sort_by=Date`
    -->
    <fieldset>
      <label>Sort by:</label>
      <ul name='sort_by'>
        <li class='selected'>Date</li>
        <li>Time</li>
      </ul>
    </fieldset>
    <!--
      ## Checkbox group (&lt;select multiple&gt;)
      
      A group with multiple selection is actually a list of checkboxes. So a selected item
      can be interpreted as checked checkbox. HTML forms only send values of checkboxes that are
      checked on. 
      
      In example below, selectlist widget has **multiple** attribute, that sets this kind of 
      item relationship. There are two items selected from the start, so query string will look
      like this: 
      
      `?type[]=Feed&type[]=Songs` and is interpreted as `{type: ["Feed", "Songs"]}`
    -->
    <fieldset>
      <label>Types:</label>
      <ul multiple='multiple' name='type'>
        <li class='selected' value='Feed'>News</li>
        <li>Photos</li>
        <li class='selected'>Songs</li>
      </ul>
    </fieldset>
  </nav>
  <!--
    ## A list with checkboxes 
    
    Selected rows should be a parameter too. So we add a name attribute here
  -->
  <ul name='people'>
    <li itemid='ibolmo' itemscope='itemscope' itemtype='person http://schema.org/Person'>
      <!--
        We're going to add a checkbox in the beginning of each item. Checkbox is a metaphor
        that people understand. It's like if it was inviting a user to select one or many items at once.
      -->
      <input type='checkbox' />
      <h2>
        <a href='http://github.com/ibolmo' itemprop='url'>
